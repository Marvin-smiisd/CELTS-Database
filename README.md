CELTS-Database
==============

For my Computer Science capstone project, I created CELTS Database for Berea College Center for Excellence in Lerning Through Service. CELTS educates students for leadership in service and social justice through promotion and coordination of academic service-learning and student-led community service. The goal of CELTS database is to provide an efficient way of storing and retrieving CELTSâ€™ data.

This Spring MVC application demonstrates the use of HTML5, MySQL database, JavaScript, Java Spring MVC, Hibernate, Java Persistence API (JPA), JSP, JSTL, and Structured Query Language (SQL) to create CRUD Web database application.
